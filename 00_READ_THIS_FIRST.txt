  085c / SOLUTION
    # Encountered some issues but it seems that...
    - 'git commit' => merge the branch to master => 'git push heroku master' solved it.

    # H10 error in Heroku. Log mentions something about sqlite and active record.

  085e / Had to revert back to 085b due to severals errors.
    - Major cause of error seems to be how I set the rails app up.
    - Should've used 'rails new myApp --skip-active-record' when making the app...
      - Make a new app and transfer files?
      - Possible to remove the active-record?
